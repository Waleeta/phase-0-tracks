User1 will enter a word. 

User2 will try to guess the word by:
	entering one letter at a time
	we check to see if the letter is included in the word given by user1.
		if it is, find where in the word it is and insert it at that position.
	otherwise, let them know it isn’t in the word and ask for a letter again. 

After each correct guess of a letter, return the incomplete word with the letters in the right position. 

We also want to keep a list of the letters given so the user knows what s/he has already guessed.

We can give them a limit of 15 guesses. If they guess a letter twice, it doesn’t add to this count. 

If the user’s response is to guess the whole word correctly, the game is over and they won, and they get a congratulations.

If the user uses all of their guesses and don’t guess right (up to 15 total), then they get a negative message.
