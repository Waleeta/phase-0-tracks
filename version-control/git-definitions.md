# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
	* This helps keep track of changes made to coding projects, including making merging easier, corrections easier, collaboration easier, and is useful for multiple people working on the same project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is a unique "path" where changes made there are unique to that branch alone. It must then be added w/ comment in order to be merged to the master branch (original) file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit is adding comments to the changes you have made to the code.
* What is a merge conflict?
	* A merge conflict happens when there is something that can't be merged seamlessly (e.g., if two people changed the same part of a code block.)
