		<p> Let's face it. Dogs are friendlier, more playful, more snuggly, more fun, and might save your life if someone tries to hurt you. Also, see: puppies.

			<li>They are <strong>always</strong> happy to see you. <em>Always.</em></li>
			<li>They love you even if everyone else hates you.</li>
			</ul>
