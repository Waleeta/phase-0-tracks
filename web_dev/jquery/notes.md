##Attacking jQuery!

>I have found the best way to approach something is to dive into it and learn as I go, and *then* go back and look at what I did and *then* read about it, which gives me context for what I'm reading.

####So here is my list, in order: 

* Look up what jQuery is :-D
* Try it in Codecademy
* While I am working in Codecademy, look up definitions or supporting documents.
* Complete final release and create my own jQuery project. 

**Wish me luck!**
