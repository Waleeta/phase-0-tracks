##Design Philosophies of Linux##
> *An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.* 
								
> *Linux and the Unix Philosphy*, Mike Gancarz

###Here are a few tenets of the Linux Philosophy:

1. Small is beautiful & each program does ONE THING well: commands/programs are simple, and specialize in doing one thing.
2.  Choose portability over efficiency: the program should work in a variety of environments, even if it is less efficient.
3. Use shell scripts: meaning, use programs that are used by the CLI.
4. Avoid captive user interfaces: user commands should be on the same "level" and avoid forcing the user to exit one to use the other.
5. Make every program a filter: Each command "filters" down further information.


##What is a VPS##

> A Virtual Private Server is a 'host' server for your web site, which is hosted virtually, off your machine (much like a Virtual Private Network). This can be good for keeping your personal machine secure and personal files off-limits. Through a variety of VPS applications online, they can be very easy to build as well. 

*Some of the benefits include:*

* Cheap, and easy to make online
* You have control over your own server, which you do not have if you share a server.
* Control your own security.
* Tech support can be available.


*It's a bad idea to run VPS programs as the root user.
> User-level programming allows for better security. A root user can aler administrative aspects of the entire machine, so this should be accessed/used rarely. Having users protects the *root* of the server/machine. Rooting will mean you have access and control to everything, no warning, you can do what you like to the machine and nothing can stop you! Users have defined levels of access.
