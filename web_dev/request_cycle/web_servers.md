##Design Philosophies of Linux##
> *An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.*

###Here are a few tenets of the Linux Philosophy:

1) Small is beautiful & each program does ONE THING well: commands/programs are simple, and specialize in doing one thing.
2) Choose portability over efficiency: the program should work in a variety of environments, even if it is less efficient.
3) Use shell scripts: meaning, use programs that are used by the CLI.
4) Avoid captive user interfaces: user commands should be on the same "level" and avoid forcing the user to exit one to use the other.
5) Make every program a filter: Each command "filters" down further information.
